# Blockchain (Phase-3)


We start implementing Decentralisation in this phase where registered users can download and upload validated blockchains into the network.


## How to Test BlockChain:


1) Download or clone this repository into a new directory in your Local.

2) Inside the new directory, Open Windows Power Shell / Command prompt and run the command `npm install`.

3) After installation is complete, run the command `npm start`.

4) Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser

5) Register with email and password

6) Add Name and amount into the fields and Submit. This will get added to the blockchain.
