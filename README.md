# Blockchain - Decentralised


This is a work in progress BlockChain application which is in early phase of development. (Phase-1)

Aim is to decentralise the application by distributing blockchains between different users. Server will not store Blockchain data in any form.

### Phase-1 : 

- API to list all blockchains, 

- API to add individual blocks into block chain

- API to POST the raw JSON data containing all blocks. Also validate the same


### Phase-2 : (Tentative)

- Create Queue for new transactions(block data) ready for mining (Proof of Work).

- Manage individual blockchain users using hash verification (User password + Server Master Key)


### Phase-3 :

Decentralisation using Socket.IO
