# Blockchain (Phase-3 : Decentralisation)


A decentralised blockchain application that distributes `blockchain` between individual users, and manages transaction records, thereby eliminating the need of a Server for storing Blockchain, transaction details in any form.

> Status: Work-in-progress



1) Implement Decentralisation using Socket.IO

2) For Developers: A piece of Code needs to be added into your website inorder to receive and transmit latest blockchain.

3) Registered Users should be able to manually download a copy of latest BlockChain on clicking a button. However, this is not required if (2) was implemented.

4) Registered Users should also be able to upload the BlockChain into the Network. However this is not required if (2) was implemented.
